\label{sec:list_of_requirements}

The content of the list of requirements is to be seen as parameters for the prototype design. 
The arguments have been refined in the analysis-chapter, and have ultimately
led to these requirements, that will help construction of the final prototype. 
Hence it is to be considered a blueprint from which numerous variations of designs can be crafted.

General requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The prototype must contain sounds that range in different levels within the same weather category.
    \item The visuals provided in testing must be based on results from either pre-testing or SOTA analysis.
    \item The sounds will have a meaning attached to them (i.e. semiosis)
    \item Symbolic representation is used to convey our message about the weather
    \item Will use the type “data exploration” of sonification to translate weather data into sound
\end{itemize}

Program functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Able to import sound file
    \item Able to play sound file
    \item Able to pause sound file
    \item Able to change the tempo of the sound
    \item Able to add filters to the sounds
\end{itemize}
