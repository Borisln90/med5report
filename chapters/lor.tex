\section{List of Requirements} \label{sec:lor}

The following listed content is to be considered relevant to implement in order to answer to the final problem statement. The following list will be denoted into a bulletin order, in no particular order where the content is of importance as deemed by the group based upon research.

\subsubsection{Pacman}
\subsubsection{Genetic Algorithm}
The following content is considered to be required to construct, develop and implement a functional genetic algorithm in accordance with the final problem statement.

Sivanandam, 2008 states that the following general content is used to develop a genetic algorithm:

\enquote{\begin{enumerate}
\item The representation of the problem
\item The fitness calculation
\item Various variables and parameters involved in controlling the algorithm
\item The representation of result and the way of terminating the algorithm
\end{enumerate}} \cite[pp. 33]{Sivanandam2008}


\begin{itemize}
\item Problem definition
\item Population size.
\item Gene encoding.
\item Fitness function and Fitness Score representation
\item Selection method operator
\item Crossover operator function and crossover probability
\item Mutation operator function and mutation probability
\item result representation
\item algorithm termination

\end{itemize}
