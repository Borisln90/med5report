pre existing Pacman software that we will use? (Research).




% Adaptive Difficulty

\subsection{Adaptive Difficulty}
SOTA: Previous implemented "difficulty" in Pacman. (research)
What parameters did others modify?
What succes criteria did they have?
what was the results? etc.

\subsubsection{Our identified criteria}
We discuss how we use what parameters to alter the "difficulty". what the success criteria for the game is, and how we plausibly could observe "what" to indicate a succesful implementation.

	We hypothesise that these parameters change the "difficulty" - and we try to see if
	theese parameters actually do something. Does this "modification" actually 
	modify our "succes criteria". The points, live or die, how long did you live etc etc.
	
	we do NOT need to define difficulty, we just find parameters to modify and look at the "ability" of the player and compare to the "succes" criteria. which would be an indication of "balanced" 
point ration. We look for a success threshold.


% Genetic algorithm

\subsection{Genetic algorithm}
introduction - what it is
\subsection{Genetic algorithm: Technical and theorical implementation}
...etc. Acount for unknown content here as i know shit about the subject.
