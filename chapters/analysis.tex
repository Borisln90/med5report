\subsection{Pacman}
\subsubsection{AI behaviour argumentation (how they do it)}
\subsubsection{Technical details/mechanics/paramters}

\subsection{Player performance}
a. Identify pacman parameters to measure player performance. (from 4.B) Associate also with  previous research(other AI implementations in Pacman. What did they use to  identify “performance”?


b. Define “good” and “bad” performance based upon 5a. (assume that we use only win/lose conditions unless prior research has based performance indications upon other game parameter results)

c. Performance results. We identify “some” performance. Therefore we configure the following “alternation of ghost behavior” in “this” way.

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm(s)}

\subsubsection{GA definitions. (what it is, and how it works}
\subsubsection{GA and Pacman(how the two can be combined.(methods)}
we must identify possible implementations of "pacman parameters" to control fitness score.
