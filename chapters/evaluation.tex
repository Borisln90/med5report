\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}
The purpose of the evaluation is to establish knowledge concerning the possibility of creating a video game AI that matches the player's performance through the use of a genetic algorithm; as stated in the final problem statement.(See section XX)


\subsection{Method}
the method of testing and evaluating said results will be constructed in the following manner;

Test subjects will be asked to play several games/levels of the product prototype whereof each game represent a new improved generation of our genetic algorithm. The general purpose is to account for the effectiveness of our genetic algorithm and the used method of alternations between the various states of the finite state machine, to evaluate whether or not the method of conduction in terms of our genetic algorithm is actually matching player performance.

There are several aspects that must be accounted for:

\begin{itemize}
\item How is player performance considered matched?
\item does our implementation of alternation between the various states of a finite state machine match player performance?
\end{itemize}



In section \ref{ssec:player-performance}, assessment of player performance is considered and the following allegation of defining player performance matched is specified as such;

The player performance will be considered matched if the attained score(points) of each game/generation of one single test participant is either similar or lower than the
