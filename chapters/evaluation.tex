\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}
The purpose of the evaluation is to establish knowledge concerning the possibility of creating a video game AI that matches the player's performance through the use of a genetic algorithm as stated in the final problem statement.(See section XX) Additionally we will be able to evaluate upon the specified requirements and evaluate the success of the method of application.

The following evaluation of the implemented product will be separated into a pretest and thereafter the actual test of product.


The general structure of evaluation will be a description of the applied test method and procedure. The procedure will thereafter be evaluated in a pretest where specific product aspects will be accounted for and plausible alterations might occur based upon the obtained results from the conducted pre test. Additionally, the method of test result collection and interpretation of said results will also be evaluated and modified if needed.


\subsubsection{Method}
The method of evaluation is to allow a number of test participants with some variation in self-perceived player ability to play x number of generations with x amount of simulations. The unknown aspects will be accounted for in the conducted pre test.

The collected data from the test participants will consist of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Points collected
\item Fitness score
\item Ghost mode percentages
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Procedure}
In this section, the general procedure for the entire evaluation will be accounted for in detail.
