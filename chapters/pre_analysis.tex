\section{Investigation} \label{sec:preanalysus}
This chapter will provide an overview of Artificial Intelligence were it set focus on Artificial intelligence non-player characters (NPC) in games. It will describe existing self-modifying Artificial Intelligence, in order to compare it to the original arcade game Pacman (1980).


\subsection{Initial Problem Statement} \label{sec:initialproblemstatement}
Is it possible to create an artificial intelligence video game opponent, which modifies itself according to the players' performance?

\subsection{Summary}
To summarize the content of investigation, there are several aspects of applicable knowledge that will make it possible to further develop a specified problem statement.

\begin{itemize}
\item Artificial intelligence\\
\item Evolutionary computation\\
in section \ref{section:selfmodifyingai},we account for the self-modifying AI opponent term and find that a possible method of self-modifications can be conducted by the use of complex adaptive systems(CAS).\\

within the field of biological computing, we find that evolutionary computation is indeed used in games, with numerous examples of successful implementations in the game of Pacman. Here several examples of genetic algorithms are applied, which is a method of evolutionary computation. The genetic algorithm, are in the specified examples used to improve the performance of either the ghosts, or the actual Pacman playing agent.
\item game delimitation\\
Additionally, as specified in section \ref{section:selfmodifyingai} we find evidence to support that it is indeed possible to implement a self modifying AI in Pacman, and find several examples of actual implementations of such.\\

Based upon the research, there are evident examples of self-modifying AI's that is able to improve the performance of the actual ghost or Pacman AI by the use of evolutionary computation. 

In Pacman, it is well known that there are several AI implementations of behaviours. Each ghost in Pacman chases Pacman in different ways, and there are implementations of behaviours whereof the ghosts will flee from pacman under specific circumstances and sometimes interrupt the chase of Pacman, only to seek out a corner of the maze for a limited amount of time before chasing Pacman again.

What if the implementation of evolutionary computation is not to control  and improve the actual behaviours of the ghosts or Pacman, but rather to control and improve the alternations between said behaviours within the game?

\item player performance\\
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Final Problem Statement} \label{sec:finalproblemstatement}
Is it possible to create an implementation of a video game AI, which alternates between a fixed set of behaviors of the opponents, according to the player's performance through the use of a genetic algorithm?
