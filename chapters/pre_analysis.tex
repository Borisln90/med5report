\section{Investigation} \label{sec:preanalysus}

\subsection{Initial Problem Statement} \label{sec:initialproblemstatement}
Is it possible to create an “Artificial Intelligence” opponent in a game, which evolves according to the players skills and performance.  An opponent that would never become too difficult or too easy, but instead create a challenge according to players performance.


\subsection{Artificial Intelligence} \label{sec:ai}
\subsection{What is AI}
\subsection{Identify exiting types of AI}
Genetic algorithm and such
\subsection{Skill and performance.}
Describe what skill and performance means. What is a challenge in games?
mention variation of difficulty which could lead to some sort of adaptive difficulty? it must depend on the type of game etc etc.
What type of methods is there to "tune" difficulty? As we are researching stuff that is never too easy nor too difficult.
\subsection{Game Selection Research}
Describe types of games to perhaps use. TD, RTS pacman etc.


\subsection{Final Problem Statement} \label{sec:finalproblemstatement}
Can an adaptive difficulty 	be implemented in Pacman through the use of a genetic algorithm?
