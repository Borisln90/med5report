\section{Investigation} \label{sec:preanalysus}
This chapter will investigate and discuss the viability of the initial problem statement from above. It will the investigate the various aspects of artificial inteligence as well as state of the art within self-modifying AIs. The chapter will also provide various delimitations as to which parts of the initial problem statement can be used for further analysis. This chapter will develop the initial problem statement into a final problem statement.

\subsection{Summary}
We identify that GA’s had indeed been implemented in Pacman in several manners, both where Pacman and the ghosts have altered behaviours. However, we find no evident material as to how a GA implementation which self modifies the alternations between the behaviours of the opponent (ghosts) could be successfully implemented. Therefore, we see if this modification is possible, and if it does indeed have some sort of impact on the player’s performance in any plausible way.


\subsection{Final Problem Statement} \label{sec:finalproblemstatement}
Is it possible to create an implementation of a video game AI, which alternates between the various states of a finite state machine, according to the player's performance through the use of a genetic algorithm?
