\section{Investigation} \label{sec:preanalysus}

\subsection{Initial Problem Statement} \label{sec:initialproblemstatement}
Is it possible to create an “Artificial Intelligence” opponent in a game, which evolves according to the players skills and performance.  An opponent that would never become too difficult or too easy, but instead create a challenge according to players performance.


\subsection{Artificial Intelligence} \label{sec:ai}
The idea of Artificial Intelligence has been around for centuries, first introduced in the Greek myth of Hephaestus. 

\subsection{Adaptive difficulty}
describe how an AI could evolve according to players skill and performance. Which could be by the use of evolutionary algorithms.
\subsubsection{what is difficulty?}
describe how one can define difficulty in games. How can difficulty be idenfitied? Is it not dependant on each specific game/game mechanics?
We find Dynamic game difficulty balancing. Perhaps research others.
\subsection{Game selection}
Define through research plausible game genres/types which can be used.
Describe that we focus on either TD, RTS and Pacman. document with aquired research.




\subsection{Final Problem Statement} \label{sec:finalproblemstatement}
Can an adaptive difficulty 	be implemented in Pacman through the use of a genetic algorithm in accordance with dynamic game difficulty balancing?
