abstract = {During the last years the well-known Ms. Pac Man video$\backslash$ngame has been - and still is - an interesting test bed$\backslash$nfor the research on various concepts from the broad$\backslash$narea of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among these$\backslash$nconcepts is the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to$\backslash$ncontrol the game from a human player's perspective.$\backslash$nSeveral GP-based approaches have been examined so far,$\backslash$nwhere traditionally they define two types of GP$\backslash$nterminals: one type for information retrieval, the$\backslash$nsecond type for issuing actions (commands) to the game$\backslash$nworld. However, by using these action terminals the$\backslash$ncontroller has to manage actions issued to the game$\backslash$nduring their runtime and to monitor their outcome. In$\backslash$norder to avoid the need for active task management this$\backslash$npaper presents a novel approach for the design of a$\backslash$nGP-based Ms. Pac Man controller: the proposed approach$\backslash$nsolely relies on information retrieval terminals in$\backslash$norder to rate all possible directions of movement at$\backslash$nevery time step during a running game. Based on these$\backslash$nrating values the controller can move the agent through$\backslash$nthe mazes of the the game world of Ms. Pac Man. With$\backslash$nthis design, which forms the main contribution of our$\backslash$nwork, we decrease the overall GP solution complexity by$\backslash$nremoving all action control management tasks from the$\backslash$nsystem. It is demonstrated that by following the$\backslash$nproposed approach such a system can successfully$\backslash$ncontrol an autonomous agent in a computer game$\backslash$nenvironment on the level of an amateur human player.},

abstract = {Ms. Pac-Man is a challenging, classic arcade game with a certain cult status. This paper reports attempts to evolve a Pac-Man player, where the control algorithm uses a neural network to evaluate the possible next moves. The evolved neural network takes a handcrafted feature vector based on a candidate maze location as input, and produces a score for that location as output. Results are reported on two simulated versions of the game: deterministic and non- deterministic. The results show that useful behaviours can be evolved that are frequently capable of clearing the first level, but are still susceptible to making poor decisions. Currently, the best evolved players play at the level of a reasonable human novice},

abstract = {Video game AI aims at generating an intelligent game opponent which is to compete with player, so game AI design plays an important role in the development of game. Nowadays, most of the game AI is implemented by FSM. But this mechanism has some drawbacks, so we need a mechanism to design game AI automatically instead of FSM. The process of automatic game AI design by UCT is introduced in this paper. In this process, we only take the meta-rules into consideration, while those many complicated detail knowledge is acquired by simulation. Here we propose the approach of UCT-controlled NPC based on CI (computational intelligence). However, this approach will consume lots of computational resources, and the acquired knowledge cannot be stored. To solve this problem, we train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to make it reusable. The whole design process is validated on the Test-Bed of the game Dead-End. We conclude that from both the simplification of implementation and the reusability, this process outperforms FSM.},

abstract = {Games provide competitive, dynamic environments that make ideal test beds for computational intelligence theories, architectures, and algorithms. Natural evolution can be considered to be a game in which the rewards for an organism that plays a good game of life are the propagation of its genetic material to its successors and its continued survival. In natural evolution, the fitness of an individual is defined with respect to its competitors and collaborators, as well as to the environment. Within the evolutionary computation (EC) literature, this is known as co-evolution and within this paradigm, expert game-playing strategies have been evolved without the need for human expertise.},

abstract = {Pac-Man is a well-known, real-time computer game that provides an interesting platform for research. We describe an initial approach to developing an artificial agent that replaces the human to play a simplified version of Pac-Man. The agent is specified as a simple finite state machine and ruleset. with parameters that control the probability of movement by the agent given the constraints of the maze at some instant of time. In contrast to previous approaches, the agent represents a dynamic strategy for playing Pac-Man, rather than a pre-programmed maze-solving method. The agent adaptively "learns" through the application of population-based incremental learning (PBIL) to adjust the agents' parameters. Experimental results are presented that give insight into some of the complexities of the game, as well as highlighting the limitations and difficulties of the representation of the agent.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines.An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text.The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.},

abstract = {Pac-Man (and variant) computer games have received some recent attention in artificial intelligence research. One reason is that the game provides a platform that is both simple enough to conduct experimental research and complex enough to require non-trivial strategies for successful game-play. This paper describes an approach to developing Pac-Man playing agents that learn game-play based on minimal onscreen information. The agents are based on evolving neural network controllers using a simple evolutionary algorithm. The results show that neuroevolution is able to produce agents that display novice playing ability, with a minimal amount of onscreen information, no knowledge of the rules of the game and a minimally informative fitness function. The limitations of the approach are also discussed, together with possible directions for extending the work towards producing better Pac-Man playing agents},
