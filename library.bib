abstract = {Ms. Pac-Man is a challenging, classic arcade game with a certain cult status. This paper reports attempts to evolve a Pac-Man player, where the control algorithm uses a neural network to evaluate the possible next moves. The evolved neural network takes a handcrafted feature vector based on a candidate maze location as input, and produces a score for that location as output. Results are reported on two simulated versions of the game: deterministic and non- deterministic. The results show that useful behaviours can be evolved that are frequently capable of clearing the first level, but are still susceptible to making poor decisions. Currently, the best evolved players play at the level of a reasonable human novice},

abstract = {Pac-Man is a well-known, real-time computer game that provides an interesting platform for research. We describe an initial approach to developing an artificial agent that replaces the human to play a simplified version of Pac-Man. The agent is specified as a simple finite state machine and ruleset. with parameters that control the probability of movement by the agent given the constraints of the maze at some instant of time. In contrast to previous approaches, the agent represents a dynamic strategy for playing Pac-Man, rather than a pre-programmed maze-solving method. The agent adaptively "learns" through the application of population-based incremental learning (PBIL) to adjust the agents' parameters. Experimental results are presented that give insight into some of the complexities of the game, as well as highlighting the limitations and difficulties of the representation of the agent.},

abstract = {During the last years the well-known Ms. Pac Man video$\backslash$ngame has been - and still is - an interesting test bed$\backslash$nfor the research on various concepts from the broad$\backslash$narea of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Among these$\backslash$nconcepts is the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to$\backslash$ncontrol the game from a human player's perspective.$\backslash$nSeveral GP-based approaches have been examined so far,$\backslash$nwhere traditionally they define two types of GP$\backslash$nterminals: one type for information retrieval, the$\backslash$nsecond type for issuing actions (commands) to the game$\backslash$nworld. However, by using these action terminals the$\backslash$ncontroller has to manage actions issued to the game$\backslash$nduring their runtime and to monitor their outcome. In$\backslash$norder to avoid the need for active task management this$\backslash$npaper presents a novel approach for the design of a$\backslash$nGP-based Ms. Pac Man controller: the proposed approach$\backslash$nsolely relies on information retrieval terminals in$\backslash$norder to rate all possible directions of movement at$\backslash$nevery time step during a running game. Based on these$\backslash$nrating values the controller can move the agent through$\backslash$nthe mazes of the the game world of Ms. Pac Man. With$\backslash$nthis design, which forms the main contribution of our$\backslash$nwork, we decrease the overall GP solution complexity by$\backslash$nremoving all action control management tasks from the$\backslash$nsystem. It is demonstrated that by following the$\backslash$nproposed approach such a system can successfully$\backslash$ncontrol an autonomous agent in a computer game$\backslash$nenvironment on the level of an amateur human player.},

abstract = {Games provide competitive, dynamic environments that make ideal test beds for computational intelligence theories, architectures, and algorithms. Natural evolution can be considered to be a game in which the rewards for an organism that plays a good game of life are the propagation of its genetic material to its successors and its continued survival. In natural evolution, the fitness of an individual is defined with respect to its competitors and collaborators, as well as to the environment. Within the evolutionary computation (EC) literature, this is known as co-evolution and within this paradigm, expert game-playing strategies have been evolved without the need for human expertise.},

@inproceedings{Gallagher2007,
abstract = {Pac-Man (and variant) computer games have received some recent attention in artificial intelligence research. One reason is that the game provides a platform that is both simple enough to conduct experimental research and complex enough to require non-trivial strategies for successful game-play. This paper describes an approach to developing Pac-Man playing agents that learn game-play based on minimal onscreen information. The agents are based on evolving neural network controllers using a simple evolutionary algorithm. The results show that neuroevolution is able to produce agents that display novice playing ability, with a minimal amount of onscreen information, no knowledge of the rules of the game and a minimally informative fitness function. The limitations of the approach are also discussed, together with possible directions for extending the work towards producing better Pac-Man playing agents},
